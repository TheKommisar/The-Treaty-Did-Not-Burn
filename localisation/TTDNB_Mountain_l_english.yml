MRC_religion_desc:0 "The Nation is heavily divided along Religious lines. The Orthodox Christians have shown nothing but disdain for the Suffi Islamic dominated government and the Muslim Community as a whole while the Southern Muslims feel a bitter distrust and a paranoia towards their former Christian overlords. The Government has so far been unable to curtail this immesne religious hatred as sportaic fighting happens between the two groups in areas of mixed religious demographics."

mountain.1.t:0 "The History of the Republic"

mountain.1.d:0 "The history of the Mountain Republic of the Northern Caucasus can best be summarized as complex and simple, short and long at the same time. While the republic itself only dates back to 1917, the history of its ideals and people date back much further. Since the days of the Caucasian Imamate the idea of the people of the North Caucasus being united under a single flag due to a shared religion and percieved close culture began to gain traction in the region among educated circles. In 1917, with the collapse of the old Russian Empire and birth of the Russian Republic that Century of constant idealism and unitary thought would be put to the test when The "Union of the Peoples of the Northern Caucasus" was created in March 1917, and an Executive Committee of the Union was elected. The Chairman of the Executive Committee was one of the leaders of the National Liberation movement of the Peoples of the Northern Caucasus, Tapa Tchermoeff, who would remain the Leader of the Republic throughout its life. Soon the republic came under threat from the Communist Revolutionary Red Army, causing the Republic to engage in a half decade long conflict with its historic Russian enemies. Soon with the Southern White Army's support the republic helped deal crippling defeats to the Red Army in the Caucasus and in the Volga, however troop morale continued to lower the further from home the Caucasian Legions went. This lowered Morale would culminate in the ending of the republics involvement in the Volga campaign, as it withdrew to the region of Stavropol, and not a moment to soon. Soon following their withdrawl the Southern White Army collapsed following the end of Ukrainian and Cossack involvement in the war effort. Fortunately for the young Mountain Republic, it was granted a place in signing the treaty with the Bolsheviks alongside the Ukrainians, and soon it found itself a a truly independent state, not to mention the added gains of the Stavropol which it had helped secure. The republic under Prime Minister Tapa Tchermoeff would not see unity and peace as expected, but a whole wave of new issues that needed attention. Without a common threat from the North the peoples of the Republic reverted to bitter factionalism and infighting. Attempts to create a national common language in Arabic not only made its constituent Federal Republics perceive the central authority as attempting to opress their identity, and it would severely anger the Northern Russian population in Stavropol. Soon the idea of a common religion would fall apart as well as the bitter hatred between Muslims and Christians continued to flare up. The central authority of the government is non-existent outside of major regional cities and even these Urban strongholds lack modern industry, infastructure and other modern commodities. The fragmented and bitterly divided republic faces intense debates over the future of the republic, with many in the government playing the need to band together against the Red Threat like a dead record while opposition to the current government stresses that the republic is little more than a measure of opression by greedy statesman and that it will collapse in upon itself by the strength of the peoples judgement. Who will triumph in such matters? Only time will tell."

mountain.2.t:0 "The Battle of Dzaudzhikau"

mountain.2.d:0 "In the city of Dzaudzhikau sporadic fighting between local Christian and Muslim Groups have broken out across the entire city. Though the city, like much of religiously divided Ossetia region, has been a sight of many religious quarrels, none on record have ever been as severe as the current fighting. According to local sources the fighting developed from an argument over prices between Orthodox Christian consumer and a Sufi Muslim merchant. Apparently their debate over the prices of certain goods soon turned to an angry complaint by the consumer and soon enough spiraled into other points of conflict, until it seemed to settle on a religious shouting match. Soon other Muslims and Christians gathered into two groups to support each side, with anger boiling as insults of 'Heathen' and 'Heretic' were thrown about the air in several different languages throughout the course of several hours. Soon however what had once been fighting with words alone soon turned to fist fighting and the two groups engaged in a brawl that escalated rapidly as more people joined the fight on either side. The local police force attempted an orderly intervention, but soon many of the officers began choosing sides along religious lines while peasants began to arm themselves, soon what had once been a brutal local brawl expanded into a gunfight in the merchant sector of the city. News of said gunfight quickly spread and Christians and Muslims alike began arming themselves with rifles, this further radicalized both sides while the police either took part in the fighting or were unable to control the situation. The city would soon be engulfed in an orgy of violence as the looting and the burning of houses of opposing religions was conducted by both sides while chaotic shootouts happened in the streets and the situation continued to deteriorate. Casualty figures are already in the hundreds as armed men attack both beligerants and civilians alike along religious lines."
