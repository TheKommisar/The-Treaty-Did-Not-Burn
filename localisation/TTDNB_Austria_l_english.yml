  #events

  austria.2.d:0 "Death has come to the empire. The shadow of the Pale Rider, not content with the harvest of souls from the Great War, has come back to Vienna to take one final life - the man who worked tirelessly for peace, hated war, and lived to see most of his empire broken into feuding princedoms. Karl von Habsburg is dead. He passed on 30 December after recurring bouts of pneumonia; exactly twenty years after his coronation in 1916. Tens of thousands of people from all corners of the former empire have arrived at his funeral to mourn the death of Europe's only prince of peace - the only statesman who wanted an end to the pointless bloodshed of the Great War, who wanted a 'peace without victory.' A devout man, Karl is surely with God now. His son, Otto, stands to inherit the throne, but will he be able to hold the failing empire together?"
  austria.3.d:0 "In the last several weeks, Crown Prince Otto von Habsburg has been preparing his coronation as Emperor of Austria; yet he was not the only one preparing for action. A cabal of disgruntled army officers and politicians, led by Engerbert Dolfuss, a former soldier, and the politician Kurt Schuschnigg, have plotted to overthrow the new emperor. As Otto was being crowned Emperor of Austria and King of Slovenia by the grace of God, right-wing revolutionaries stormed the palace grounds. Taking over the coronation grounds, the plotters publicly demanded the abdication of Otto and the abolishment of the Austrian Empire."
  austria.4.d:0 "After Otto was forced at gunpoint to surrender the crown, a number of army units refused to accept it. A regiment of Slovenian infantry, unwilling to accept certain German dominion over possible Habsburg harshness, took the lead and stormed the plotters' headquarters, successfully capturing it. Engelbert Dolfuss was killed in the fighting and Kurt Schuschnigg was captured, and the rest of the plotters have been either killed or dispersed. A new coronation has been arranged for Otto, this time guarded by the Slovenians. Otto was crowned as king and emperor, and has promised to enact sweeping reforms to reverse the empire's decay. Time will tell if he is successful, but the empire is once more given some hope for the future."
  austria.5.d:0 "After forcing the deposition of Otto von Habsburg, the new provisional government of Austria almost immediately came under attack by a regiment of Slovenian infantry; reinforcements had arrived, however, in the form of an officer named Arthur Seyss-Inquart and his command, which repulsed the Slovenians despite heavy casualties. With Vienna firmly under the plotters' control, and the rest of the country falling quickly, the provisional government has openly adopted a Germanophile, authoritarian stance that has radicalized many Slovenians. Already, several Slovenian army units have refused stand-down orders and have instead begun fortifying the major towns of the southern marches."
  austria.100.d:0 "Following their conquest of Serbia, the resurgent Habsburg Empire has come to us with demands for the return of Prince Wied to the Albanian throne as well as our entry into their sphere of influence. Though few in Albania wish for a return to foreign domination, it would perhaps be foolish to reject the Austrians after they have already proven their military strength."
  austria.101.d:0 "Shortly after they received our ultimatum, the Albanian government decided that it was in their best interests to accept our demands and return Prince Wied to the throne. The small country is now firmly within our sphere of influence."
  austria.102.d:0 "Today the Imperial Government of Austria has sent us a telegram demanding that Horthy step down as regent and restore Habsburg rule to Hungary. Though Otto von Habsburg is indeed our legitimate king, the question is whether or not the Hungarian people are ready to go back to being under the Austrian boot."
  austria.103.d:0 "Horthy has accepted our demands for the restoration of Hungary under Habsburg rule. In Vienna and Budapest, preparations are already being made for the coronation of Otto I as King of Hungary."
  austria.104.d:0 "Rather than restoring Habsburg rule over his country as we were expecting him to, it seems that Miklos Horthy has decided to proclaim Hungary a Republic instead, formally bringing an end to the Kingdom that existed in at least some form since the middle ages, This is unfortunate news indeed..."
  austria.108.d:0 "Once again, the Habsburg Eagle has spread its wings across the Danube, and many of our former Empire's great cities are once again under Austrian control. However, with our recent conquests, one question remains. How should the Kaiser's various territories be organized? Some are proposing that we work with the numerous Hungarian loyalists to restore the Dual Monarchy to its previous structure. Others propose that we should federalize our former Empire into a United States of Greater Austria in which the many minorities may be united under one identity. Of course, the military along with many right-wing politicians feel that keeping these territories under a tight leash and ruling them directly from Vienna may be the most efficient way to rule over our newly-reconquered territories. The choice lies in the hands of Kaiser Otto. Which path shall we pursue?"
